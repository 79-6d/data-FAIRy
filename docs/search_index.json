How to build this book locally This material has been written using bookdown and R. The dependencies of this project is managed using renv. To build the book locally, clone the repo. If dependencies are not automatically installed by renv when you open data-fairy.Rproj, try the following command. renv::restore() then run the following lines to build the book: setwd(here()) # set working directory to project root directory bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) And view it with: browseURL(&quot;docs/index.html&quot;) "],

Please ensure that the file names for your images corresponds to your data record in IPT so that the information is properly linked. Communities If your upload is an Antarctic biodiversity dataset, please associate the following communities to your upload: SCAR Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research SCAR Antarctic Biodiversity Portal It helps us to trace what are the datasets uploaded and make your dataset more findable. Basic information Title Please use the same title as your publication in IPT with a suffix -multimedia, e.g.: My title from IPT-multimedia License We recommend Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license for the specimen images, where users are free to share and adapt your multimedia but they must give appropriate credit to you, provide a link to the license and indicate if changes were made.
